I have developed a series of teaching materials in neuroscience, aimed at undergraduates.  
These include:

- [Diffusion Models for De Novo CNS Drug Discovery](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/diffusion-models-for-de-novo-cns-drug-discovery/282007613)
- [Multimodal Deep Learning for Early Schizophrenia Prediction](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/multimodal-deep-learning-for-early-schizophrenia-prediction/282008957)
- [Explainable AI in Neurodegenerative Disease Progression](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/explainable-ai-in-neurodegenerative-disease-progression/282080385)
- [Generative AI for Synthetic Neuroimaging Data](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/generative-ai-for-synthetic-neuroimaging-data/282127682)
- [Graph Neural Networks in Brain Connectivity Analysis](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/graph-neural-networks-in-brain-connectivity-analysis/282205385)

This experience demonstrates transferable skills in teaching and mentoring, which I aim to further develop during doctoral studies.
