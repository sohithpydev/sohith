Education
======
* B.E. in Bioinformatics, SIMATS University, 2026
*Relevant Coursework: Applied Statistics & Probability | Systems Biology | Cell & Molecular Biology | Recombinant DNA Technology *


RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======
**Remote Research Assistant [Manipal University College, Malaysia]**                                                 
*Apr ’24 - Present*

Analyzed S. nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS, identifying 50 bioactive components under Dr. Sugapriya's guidance; established a foundation for novel antimicrobial research using plant-based compounds. Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase (2XJA) using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents in S. nigrum extract; discovered anthracene, 9-ethyl-9,10-dihydro as a promising anti-TB compound.
Applied a systems biology approach to tuberculosis research, identifying key hub genes responsible for the disease. Utilized Cytoscape for network analysis and R programming (with caret, dplyr, ggplot2 packages) for data analysis, machine learning model building, and visualization to complement the wet lab research.
Collaborated on comprehensive drug discovery and therapeutics reviews with Dr. Sugapriya, integrating her leukemia-focused wet lab research with my dry lab expertise, advancing interdisciplinary research on emerging medical challenges.

**Undergraduate Research Student [Saveetha School of Engineering, India]**
*Jan ’23 - Mar ’24*

Under Dr. Kannan's supervision, conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Alzheimer's drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn; implemented and compared machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) with scikit-learn, achieving 82% accuracy with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. 
Performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's rule of 5 with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug molecules.
