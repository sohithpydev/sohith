Dexmedetomidine is a highly versatile alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties, making it an invaluable agent in the field of anaesthesia and critical care. Its efficacy and safety profile have led to its use via various routes of administration, catering to different patient populations and clinical scenarios. In intensive care units (ICUs), dexmedetomidine infusion has emerged as a cornerstone for sedation due to its ability to provide sedation while maintaining a patient's ability to interact and cooperate during procedures, facilitating early extubation and reducing the risk of delirium. The sublingual route of dexmedetomidine administration has gained attention for preoperative anxiolysis, offering a convenient and effective alternative to traditional sedatives. In the realm of regional anaesthesia and pain management, dexmedetomidine delivered via intrathecal infusion has demonstrated efficacy in perioperative pain control, reducing opioid requirements and improving postoperative outcomes.
