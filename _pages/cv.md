Education
======
B.E. in Bioinformatics, SIMATS University, 2026

*Relevant Coursework: Applied Statistics & Probability | Systems Biology | Cell & Molecular Biology | Recombinant DNA Technology*


RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
======
**Remote Research Assistant [Manipal University College, Malaysia]**                                                 
*Apr ’24 - Present*

* Analyzed S. nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS, identifying 50 bioactive components under Dr. Sugapriya's guidance
* Established a foundation for novel antimicrobial research using plant-based compounds.
* Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase (2XJA) using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents in S. nigrum extract; discovered anthracene, 9-ethyl-9,10-dihydro as a promising anti-TB compound.
* Applied a systems biology approach to tuberculosis research, identifying key hub genes responsible for the disease. Utilized Cytoscape for network analysis and R programming (with caret, dplyr, ggplot2 packages) for data analysis, machine learning model building, and visualization to complement the wet lab research.
* Collaborated on comprehensive drug discovery and therapeutics reviews with Dr. Sugapriya, integrating her leukemia-focused wet lab research with my dry lab expertise, advancing interdisciplinary research on emerging medical challenges.

**Undergraduate Research Student [Saveetha School of Engineering, India]**    
*Jan ’23 - Mar ’24*

* Under Dr. Kannan's supervision, conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Alzheimer's drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn
* Implemented and compared machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) with scikit-learn, achieving 82% accuracy with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates.
* Performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's rule of 5 with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug molecules.

Volunteering Experience
====
**Data Science Intern [Suvidha Foundation, Nagpur]**                                                                              
*Nov’23 - Dec’23*

* Implemented predictive modeling techniques to optimize resource allocation within the NGO, leading to a 25% reduction in project overhead costs and enhancing operational efficiency across all departments by streamlining resource distribution, and raised Rs. 2000 in additional funding for the organization.

**Teaching Intern [Jeevan Jagriti Foundation, Delhi]**                                                                                
*Sep’22 - Jan’23*

* Conducted online classes for underprivileged students using Google Meet, ensuring 80% attendance. Improved student pass rate to 70% and significantly boosted one student's final score from 70 to 90+.
* Led workshops for parents on student wellness and managed learning materials provided through donations, optimizing the educational experience for remote learners.
