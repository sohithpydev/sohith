This review explores the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in periodontal treatment, emphasizing its synergy with patient record maintenance, risk assessment, and prediction. AI-driven systems enhance the accuracy of diagnosing and monitoring periodontal diseases, enabling early detection and screening. The integration of AI facilitates personalized and AI-supported periodontal education, tailoring preventive strategies to individual patient profiles. By analyzing vast datasets, AI models can predict disease progression and treatment outcomes, thus optimizing patient care. Additionally, AI's application in periodontal research accelerates the discovery of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. This review highlights how AI not only improves clinical decision-making but also revolutionizes periodontal research and education, leading to more effective, personalized, and evidence-based periodontal care.
