üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm a final year undergraduate in Bioinformatics at Saveetha School of Engineering, SIMATS University, Chennai.

üß¨ My passion lies in combining biology with machine learning to solve real-world healthcare problems. I work at the intersection of computational drug discovery, AI-powered diagnostics, and molecular modeling, with a focus on diseases such as tuberculosis, leukemia, and schizophrenia.

üßëüèΩ‚Äçüî¨ I'm currently a research intern at KEK, Japan and I‚Äôve recently interned at National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan, where I've analyzed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data to develop ML models for TB classification. My work also extends to QSAR modeling, systems biology, and predictive analytics in biomedical research.

üìö I‚Äôve contributed to multiple international research projects, filed patents, published peer-reviewed papers, and love mentoring students in STEM, especially when it comes to making complex science accessible.

üåè Outside the lab, I‚Äôm a travel and food enthusiast who loves discovering new places and flavors during my internships abroad. Whether it‚Äôs finding a quiet caf√© to sketch ideas or planning my next research sprint, I‚Äôm always exploring the world around me. I hope to continue this balance of adventure and academic growth throughout my master‚Äôs and PhD journey.

Let‚Äôs connect and collaborate if you‚Äôre into impactful science, global research, or great coffee ‚òïÔ∏è!

*JAN' 25 - JUN' 25*

Operating MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer at [Biophysics Mass Spectrometry Lab, NDHU](http://faculty.ndhu.edu.tw/~PENGW/contact/) for TB and NTM sample analysis under the supervision of [Dr. Wing Peng-Ping](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wen-Ping-Peng/research) and developing ML models for tuberculosis classification using acquired spectral data and performing statistical analysis and feature selection to identify significant m/z peaks, coupled with spectral data visualization for enhanced interpretability.

*MAY' 24 - APR'24*

Analyzed Solanum nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS data, successfully identifying 50 bioactive components under the guidance of [Dr. Sugapriya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=dieHes4AAAAJ). This research has laid the groundwork for novel antimicrobial investigations using plant-based compounds. Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents from S. nigrum extract. Currently, I am assisting with writing research papers, contributing to book chapters, and supporting various ongoing projects in the field of antimicrobial research.

*MAR' 25 - APR' 25*

During this internship, I focused on histological analysis of the central nervous system post-irradiation, with two key objectives. First, I performed manual classification of neurons and glial cells using ImageJ‚Äôs Cell Counter plugin. I mapped anatomical brain regions with guidance from the Allen Brain Atlas and classical histology references. Second, I quantified apoptotic cell death by analyzing TUNEL-stained sections to detect and compare TUNEL-positive cells between control and irradiated samples. This integrated approach combined traditional neurohistology with digital image analysis to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CNS pathology assessment.

*SEP' 24 - NOV' 24*

I worked on selecting peptides with potential anti-cancer activity by analyzing key biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, net charge, stability, half-life, and Boman index. These properties help determine a peptide's ability to interact with cancer cell membranes, stability in biological environments, and target specificity. Using correlation heat maps and PCA analysis, our team identified 28 bacterial peptides, 18 probiotic bacterial peptides, 6 fungal peptides, and 4 metagenomic peptides. My specific focus was on peptides from the soil bacterium Streptomyces parvus, contributing to the overall findings of potential anti-cancer candidates.

*JAN' 23 - MAR' 24*

Under the supervision of [Dr. Kannan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=RwsuY0gAAAAJ), I conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia‚Äôs drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. I implemented and compared various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), achieving an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. Additionally, I performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's Rule of Five with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug candidates.
