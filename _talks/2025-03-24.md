Circadian rhythms, although inherently fluctuating, play a critical role in maintaining physiological precision across biological systems. This study explores how a sinusoidal waveform inherent in circadian patterns contributes to the reduction of fluctuations in gene expression and biochemical processes. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we demonstrate that sinusoidal regulation minimizes coefficient of variation (CV) in periodic outputs more effectively than non-sinusoidal patterns. Our findings highlight that the smooth and continuous nature of sine curves can be leveraged to enhance temporal precision, offering insights for designing synthetic biological clocks and stable gene expression systems.
