Dental implants are the most innovative strategy for substituting a missing tooth. Smoking has been identified as a significant risk factor impacting the success rates of dental implants. This study explores the correlation between tobacco use and implant failure focusing on the physiological mechanisms involved. Smoking impairs osseointegration, the critical process where the implant integrates with the alveolar bone due to reduced blood flow oxygenation and angiogenesis caused by nicotine and carbon monoxide. Smokers exhibit higher rates of implant failure compared to non-smokers with compromised bone quality and delayed wound healing as contributing factors. Studies suggest that smoking adversely affects implant stability, particularly during the critical early healing phase. This review highlights the biological mechanisms and clinical implications of smoking on dental implant outcomes.


Key words:  Implants, osseointegration, smoking, titanium
