Developed a computational drug discovery tool to identify lead compounds targeting Acute Myeloid Leukemia-associated proteins, including Tyrosine Kinase, MCL-1, Protein Kinase C, and Histone Acetyltransferase. The study employed QSAR modeling, comparing various machine learning models to predict compound potency based on pIC50 values. Bioactivity data for TKIs were retrieved from the ChEMBL database, and descriptors were computed using PaDEL. The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the highest accuracy at 92%. Molecular docking was performed using PyRX to validate lead compounds, with binding affinities visualized in Chimera. ADMET properties were assessed using ADMETlab2.0, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation was conducted via GROMACS. This tool effectively identified a novel lead compound capable of inhibiting Tyrosine Kinase activity, potentially halting leukemia progression.
