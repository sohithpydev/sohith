Stress is a major concern in today's fast-paced world. Two innovative concepts aim to combat stress using technology: SaYoPillow, a smart pillow predicting stress based on sleep data, and a web application detecting current stress levels through user input. SaYoPillow offers a proactive approach with high accuracy, while the web app prioritizes accessibility and user control over data. By potentially working together, these concepts could provide a more well-rounded understanding of stress, empowering users with effective stress management strategies.

We developed a stress detection tool by leveraging Smart-Yoga Pillow (SaYo) parameters to analyze the relationship between sleeping habits and stress levels. Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm in Python, which achieved a remarkable 96% accuracy in detecting stress. The model utilized key metrics such as blood oxygen levels, rapid eye movement, sleeping hours, heart rate, and other relevant parameters, allowing users to input their data and receive stress detection results. This tool enhances the understanding of how sleep patterns correlate with stress, providing actionable insights for better stress management.
