üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student specializing in bioinformatics at **SIMATS, Chennai**.

üßëüèΩ‚Äçüî¨ My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and healthcare, with a focus on neurodegenerative disorders such as Epilepsy, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis. Additionally, I am actively engaged in mass spectrometry analysis and systems biology to drive biomedical innovations.

üìö I'm currently working on building an AI-driven platform for the early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis!

üìà I'm also interested in assisting others on their path in bioinformatics and academia.

**Research Intern, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan**                                                                              
*JAN' 25 - JUN' 25*

Operating MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer at [Biophysics Mass Spectrometry Lab, NDHU](http://faculty.ndhu.edu.tw/~PENGW/contact/) for TB and NTM sample analysis under the supervision of [Dr. Wing Peng-Ping](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wen-Ping-Peng/research) and developing ML models for tuberculosis classification using acquired spectral data and performing statistical analysis and feature selection to identify significant m/z peaks, coupled with spectral data visualization for enhanced interpretability.

*APR' 24 - PRESENT*

Analyzed Solanum nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS data, successfully identifying 50 bioactive components under the guidance of [Dr. Sugapriya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=dieHes4AAAAJ). This research has laid the groundwork for novel antimicrobial investigations using plant-based compounds. Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents from S. nigrum extract. Currently, I am assisting with writing research papers, contributing to book chapters, and supporting various ongoing projects in the field of antimicrobial research.

**Research Intern, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow, Russia**                                                                     
*MAR' 25 - APR' 25*

During this internship, I focused on histological analysis of the central nervous system post-irradiation, with two key objectives. First, I performed manual classification of neurons and glial cells using ImageJ‚Äôs Cell Counter plugin. I mapped anatomical brain regions with guidance from the Allen Brain Atlas and classical histology references. Second, I quantified apoptotic cell death by analyzing TUNEL-stained sections to detect and compare TUNEL-positive cells between control and irradiated samples. This integrated approach combined traditional neurohistology with digital image analysis to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CNS pathology assessment.

**Remote Research Intern, Genomac Hub, Ogbomosho, Nigeria**                                                                                      
*SEP' 24 - NOV' 24*

I worked on selecting peptides with potential anti-cancer activity by analyzing key biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, net charge, stability, half-life, and Boman index. These properties help determine a peptide's ability to interact with cancer cell membranes, stability in biological environments, and target specificity. Using correlation heat maps and PCA analysis, our team identified 28 bacterial peptides, 18 probiotic bacterial peptides, 6 fungal peptides, and 4 metagenomic peptides. My specific focus was on peptides from the soil bacterium Streptomyces parvus, contributing to the overall findings of potential anti-cancer candidates.

**Undergraduate Research Student, Saveetha School of Engineering, Chennai, India**                                                              
*JAN' 23 - MAR' 24*

Under the supervision of [Dr. Kannan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=RwsuY0gAAAAJ), I conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia‚Äôs drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. I implemented and compared various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), achieving an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. Additionally, I performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's Rule of Five with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug candidates.
