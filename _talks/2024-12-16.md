title: "Discovery and Design of Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) for Potential Anti-Lung Cancer Therapy through Multi-Omics and Machine Learning"
excerpt: "The goal of our project was to predict Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from various organisms like bacteria, fungi, probiotic bacteria and metagenomic samples 
and to design potent Anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) from AMPs and study their physiochemical properties"

I worked on selecting peptides with potential anti-cancer activity by analyzing key biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, net charge, stability, half-life, and Boman index. 
These properties help determine a peptideâ€™s ability to interact with cancer cell membranes, its stability in biological environments, and targeting specificity. Using correlation heat 
maps and PCA analysis, our team identified 28 bacterial peptides, 18 probiotic bacterial peptides, 6 fungal peptides, and 4 metagenomic peptides. 
My specific focus was on peptides from the soil bacterium Streptomyces parvus, contributing to the overall findings of potential anti-cancer candidates.
