üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm a final-year undergraduate in Bioinformatics at Saveetha School of Engineering, SIMATS University, Chennai ‚Äî passionate about merging neuroscience, structural biology, and AI to tackle complex healthcare challenges.

üß† Currently, I‚Äôm an Undergraduate Student Researcher at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (with Ioncure), where I‚Äôm developing AI-driven methods to evaluate neurodegeneration awareness using NLP, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. This complements my broader work in computational drug discovery, AI-powered diagnostics, and molecular modeling.

üî¨ Over the past year, I‚Äôve had the privilege of interning at leading research institutes across Asia:

- Chang Gung University, Taiwan ‚Äì Working on molecular docking studies for drug-target interaction analysis.

- KEK, Japan ‚Äì At the Structural Biology Research Center (SBRC) under Miki Senda-sensei & Toshio Moriya-sensei, focusing on X-ray crystallography refinement and Cryo-EM analysis of protein‚Äìligand complexes, and creating English technical manuals for future international interns.

- National Dong Hwa University, Taiwan ‚Äì As a TEEP@Asia+ Scholar in the Biophysical Mass Spectrometry Lab, I developed a machine learning pipeline using MALDI-TOF MS data for TB/NTM classification, achieving 0.98 AUROC and 0.94 F1-score with significant diagnostic improvements.

üìö I‚Äôve contributed to international collaborations, filed patents, published peer-reviewed papers, and actively mentor students in STEM, making complex science more accessible. My outreach extends through books, podcasts, and blogs ([link here]), aiming to inspire and inform the next generation of scientists.

üåè Beyond the lab, I‚Äôm a travel and food enthusiast ‚Äî from quiet caf√©s in Taiwan to bustling ramen joints in Tokyo ‚Äî always looking for places that spark new research ideas. I plan to carry this blend of scientific curiosity and global exploration into my Master‚Äôs and PhD journey.

*MAR' 25 - APR' 25*

During this internship, I focused on histological analysis of the central nervous system post-irradiation, with two key objectives. First, I performed manual classification of neurons and glial cells using ImageJ‚Äôs Cell Counter plugin. I mapped anatomical brain regions with guidance from the Allen Brain Atlas and classical histology references. Second, I quantified apoptotic cell death by analyzing TUNEL-stained sections to detect and compare TUNEL-positive cells between control and irradiated samples. This integrated approach combined traditional neurohistology with digital image analysis to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CNS pathology assessment.

*SEP' 24 - NOV' 24*

I worked on selecting peptides with potential anti-cancer activity by analyzing key biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, net charge, stability, half-life, and Boman index. These properties help determine a peptide's ability to interact with cancer cell membranes, stability in biological environments, and target specificity. Using correlation heat maps and PCA analysis, our team identified 28 bacterial peptides, 18 probiotic bacterial peptides, 6 fungal peptides, and 4 metagenomic peptides. My specific focus was on peptides from the soil bacterium Streptomyces parvus, contributing to the overall findings of potential anti-cancer candidates.

**Undergraduate Research Student, Saveetha School of Engineering, Chennai, India (On-site)**                                                              
*JAN' 23 - MAR' 24*

Under the supervision of [Dr. Kannan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=RwsuY0gAAAAJ), I conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia‚Äôs drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. I implemented and compared various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), achieving an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. Additionally, I performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's Rule of Five with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug candidates.
