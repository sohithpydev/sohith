üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student specializing in bioinformatics at **SIMATS, Chennai**.

üßëüèΩ‚Äçüî¨ My research interests are Tuberculosis, Biological non-linear dynamics, Computational Neuroscience, and Systems biology.

üìö I'm currently working on building an AI-driven platform for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis!

üìà I'm also interested in assisting others on their path in bioinformatics and academia.

*JAN' 25 - Present*

Operating MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer at [Biophysics Mass Spectrometry Lab, NDHU](http://faculty.ndhu.edu.tw/~PENGW/contact/) for sample analysis and developing ML models for tuberculosis classification using acquired spectral data.
Performing statistical analysis and feature selection to identify significant m/z peaks, coupled with spectral data visualization for enhanced interpretability. Supervisor: [Dr. Wing Peng-Ping](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wen-Ping-Peng/research)

*Apr'24-Present*

Analyzed Solanum nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS data, successfully identifying 50 bioactive components under the guidance of [Dr. Sugapriya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=dieHes4AAAAJ). This research has laid the groundwork for novel antimicrobial investigations using plant-based compounds.
Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents from S. nigrum extract. Currently, I am assisting with writing research papers, contributing to book chapters, and supporting various ongoing projects in the field of antimicrobial research.

*Sep'24-Nov'24*

I worked on selecting peptides with potential anti-cancer activity by analyzing key biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, net charge, stability, half-life, and Boman index. These properties help determine a peptide's ability to interact with cancer cell membranes, its stability in biological environments, and its targeting specificity. Using correlation heat maps and PCA analysis, our team identified 28 bacterial peptides, 18 probiotic bacterial peptides, 6 fungal peptides, and 4 metagenomic peptides. My specific focus was on peptides from the soil bacterium Streptomyces parvus, contributing to the overall findings of potential anti-cancer candidates.

*Jan'23 - Mar'24*

Under the supervision of [Dr. Kannan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=RwsuY0gAAAAJ), I conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Alzheimer‚Äôs drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. I implemented and compared various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), achieving an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. Additionally, I performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's Rule of Five with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug candidates.
