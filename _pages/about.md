🧑🏽‍💻 I'm a pre-final year undergraduate student specialising in bioinformatics at **SIMATS, Chennai**.

🧑🏽‍🔬 My research interests are Tuberculosis, Biological non-linear dynamics, Computational neuroscience, and Systems biology.

📚 I'm currently working on building a server: **SchizoDock**, a computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tool for schizophrenia!

📈 I'm also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of bioinformatics and academia.

**Remote Research Assistant, Manipal University College, Melaka, Malaysia**                                                                       
*Apr'24-Present*

Analyzed Solanum nigrum extract for antibacterial compounds using GC-MS data, successfully identifying 50 bioactive components under the guidance of [Dr. Sugapriya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=dieHes4AAAAJ). This research has laid the groundwork for novel antimicrobial investigations using plant-based compounds.
Conducted in silico docking studies on M. tuberculosis MurE ligase using AutoDock Vina to identify potential anti-TB agents from S. nigrum extract.

**Previous Experience**

**Undergraduate Research Student, Saveetha School of Engineering, Chennai, India**                                                                       
*January 2023 - March 2024*

Under the supervision of Dr. Kannan, I conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ChEMBL dataset for Alzheimer’s drug discovery using pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. I implemented and compared various machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost), achieving an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest for predicting potential drug candidates. Additionally, I performed molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, applied Lipinski's Rule of Five with RDKit, and executed molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS to validate and analyze protein-ligand interactions of promising Alzheimer's drug candidates.
