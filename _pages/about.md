Here's an overview of my journey so far!

Academic and Research Pursuits
=========
Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Bioinformatics at Saveetha School of Engineering, SIMATS, my academic journey is driven by a deep interest in Computational Biology. 
My ultimate goal is to merge my passion for teaching and research, with aspirations of becoming a professor or a cancer researcher‚Äîperhaps both! During my studies, I‚Äôve excelled as 
the subject topper in Molecular Biology and Immunology, which has been a significant academic milestone. As a TEEP Scholar, I am set to join National Dong Hwa University (NDHU), Taiwan, in January 2025 as a Student Research Intern, where I will focus on machine learning and mass spectrometry analysis for my upcoming research.

Research Experience
=======
In my role as a Remote Research Assistant at Manipal University College, Malaysia, I‚Äôve delved into plant-based antimicrobial research, analyzing bioactive components in S. nigrum extract. Under Dr. Sugapriya's guidance, I employed GC-MS for compound identification and in silico docking studies using AutoDock Vina, discovering potential anti-TB agents. 
My work extended to tuberculosis research, using systems biology approaches and Cytoscape for network analysis. At my University, I worked under Dr. Kannan on Alzheimer‚Äôs drug discovery, utilizing machine learning models like Random Forest and molecular docking simulations to predict drug candidates with high accuracy.

Industry Internships and Contributions
======
My passion for applied data science led me to intern at Genomac Hub as an anti-cancer research intern, where I explore cutting-edge cancer research. Previously, I worked as a Data Science Intern at Suvidha Foundation, where I applied predictive modeling techniques, reducing project costs and raising additional funding for the NGO. I also volunteered at Jeevan Jagriti Foundation, teaching underprivileged students and significantly improving their academic performance. My initiative, starting a tutoring academy, has allowed me to further nurture students toward achieving their academic goals.

Publications and Presentations
=======
I‚Äôve had the privilege of contributing to various publications and conferences. I co-authored papers on dexmedetomidine and AI's role in periodontal treatment, which are published in notable journals. Additionally, my work on QSAR modeling for leukemia treatment earned me first place at the Celestra 2024 conference. I‚Äôm also listed as a co-inventor on two patents, including one for an AI-driven healthcare platform and a plant extract analyzer for disease detection.

Skills and Academic Projects
=======
Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve honed both laboratory and computational skills. From molecular docking and PCR to machine learning models and Python programming, I‚Äôve leveraged a range of tools for research projects. Key projects include modeling tumor growth dynamics and developing a stress detection tool using machine learning. These projects underscore my ability to bridge wet lab research with computational approaches, advancing interdisciplinary studies.

Let‚Äôs Connect!
=======
I‚Äôm always eager to learn and collaborate, especially in the fields of bioinformatics, cancer research, and machine learning. If you share similar interests or have insights into these exciting domains, let‚Äôs connect! Together, we can explore innovative solutions to today‚Äôs biomedical challenges.
