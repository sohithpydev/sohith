**Introduction:** Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of aberrant white blood cells, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among males. Targeting key enzymes involved in AML progression represents a promising therapeutic strategy. **Methods:** This study applied computational drug discovery techniques to identify potential AML inhibitors targeting Tyrosine Kinase (TK), Protein Kinase C Beta (PKC), Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT). Inhibitors were retrieved from the ChEMBL database, molecular descriptors computed using PaDEL, and machine learning models evaluated via LazyPredict. QSAR modeling with a Random Forest Regressor achieved >90% accuracy in predicting pIC50 values. Lead compounds underwent molecular docking (PyRx), ADMET profiling (ADMETlab2.0), and molecular dynamics simulations (NMSim) to assess binding affinity, pharmacokinetics, and stability. **Results:** The QSAR model showed a strong correlation between predicted and experimental pIC50 values. Docking studies and ADMET analysis identified a novel compound with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and strong inhibitory potential. MD simulations confirmed stable binding conformations within target enzymes. **Discussion:** The integration of QSAR modeling, docking, and ADMET screening efficiently identified promising AML enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the value of computational pipelines in early-stage drug discovery. **Conclusion:** This study highlights a novel lead compound with potential as a multi-target AML therapeutic candidate, warranting further in vitro and in vivo validation.
