In this session, we delved into the complexities of leukemia, covering its definition, causes, and the critical proteins involved in its progression. We explored innovative strategies for effectively targeting these proteins, highlighting the potential of therapeutic interventions.

A significant focus was placed on Computational Drug Discovery (CDD), which plays a crucial role in identifying promising drug candidates for leukemia treatment. We examined how Machine Learning (ML) enhances CDD by improving predictive models and optimizing the drug design process, thus accelerating the journey from research to viable therapies.

Additionally, we reviewed a web application developed to aid in the identification of lead compounds specifically targeting leukemia. The session concluded with an assessment of the drug-likeliness of the lead compound identified through our computational methods, evaluating its potential for future development.

This talk emphasized the intersection of technology and biomedicine in combating leukemia, showcasing the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in cancer research.
