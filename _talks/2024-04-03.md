The talk was about identifying lead compounds targeting Tyrosine Kinase for acute myeloid leukemia using QSAR modeling and molecular docking. This study curated a dataset of 3000 compounds, comparing machine learning models to predict pIC50 values and assess binding affinity. The Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy at 92%, identifying a novel lead compound to inhibit Tyrosine Kinase.
